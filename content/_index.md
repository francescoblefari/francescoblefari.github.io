        My main research interests include Web Security and Exploitation, Log analysis and monitoring for anomaly detection, exploitation of GenAI technology for cybersecurity.

        My research has been published in international conferences such as ARES, ICWE, and ITASEC, with recent work exploring agent-based cyber defense, large language model vulnerabilities, and browser security.

        I enjoy working at the intersection of academia, industry, and education building secure systems, sharing knowledge, and exploring how AI and automation can strengthen cyber defense.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a PhD student of the National Interest PhD Course in Cubersecurity at the IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca and Department of Computer Science, Modeling, Electronic and System Engineering (DIMES) of the University of Calabria.

During my Ph.D. , in 2024, I was a visiting researcher in Concordia Information Security Research (CISR) Lab, Concordia University, Montreal. Currently I'm visiting researcher in University of Bradford, United Kingdom.

At the University of Calabria, I teach courses on Software Security and Engineering, focusing on topics like threat modeling, binary exploitation, software testing, and distributed systems with gRPC. I’m also involved in national training programs like CyberChallenge.IT, where I mentor students in hands-on cybersecurity.
